# rarbg-move-subs
Python script that automates looping through a bunch of RARGB movie torrent folders and moving subtitle files into the same folder as the movie file.

## Inspiration
Ever get tired of having to manually move all your subtitle files into the same folder as its relevant movie file?
Want to remove those annoying 'rarbg_do_not_mirror.exe' and 'rarbg.txt' files?
**Look no further**

### Instructions
1. Run `python script.py`
2. Window dialog will open up to select a folder. Select the folder containing all the movie torrent folders.
3. **Boom!** All the sub files are now in the respective folder of its movie file (No need to select your sub file in VLC anymore and you can now watch with subs hassle-free on your TV).
